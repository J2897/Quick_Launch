Miss those little icons on your taskbar? Put them back!

*This has been successfully tested on 64-Bit Windows 7.*

The Windows 7 DE (Desktop Environment) doesn't have Quick Launch - a feature widely used in Windows XP - although, when you install a program, many still add icons to the Quick Launch folder.

See the [example.png] [1] image.

This batch script will create a Symbolic Link to your Quick Launch folder. And then, all you have to do is add that Symbolic Link to your taskbar as a new toolbar by following the very simple on-screen instructions. Here the are in case you accidentally close the Command Prompt...

		The Quick Launch Symbolic Link has been created.

		To add it as a toolbar, right-click on your taskbar and go:

			Toolbars > New toolbar...

		Browse to, and select, the new Quick Launch Symbolic Link:

			C:\Users\<name>\Quick Launch

		Right-click on your taskbar and untick 'Lock the taskbar'.

		Drag the new toolbar where you like.

		Right-click the new toolbar and untick these two options:

			Show Text
			Show title

		And don't forget to 'Lock the taskbar'. Enjoy! :)
